# Journal prompts

I kept creating lists of prompts for writing, blogging, drawing etc. I wanted to put them up on a site for people to make use of as well. 

[View the journal prompts site here](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/)

Currently the site just has a list of prompts, categorised by 

- [Journaling](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/journaling)
- [Braindump](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/braindump)
- [Blog posts](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/blog-posts)
- [Drawing](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/drawing)
- [Morning pages](https://www.journalprompts.co.uk/morning-pages)

I see it as a tool for poeple to quickly open, be inspired and create. It is also a great resource that I would like to grow as much as possible, time and contributions permitting!
