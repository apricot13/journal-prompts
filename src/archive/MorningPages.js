       You should definitely pick up a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artists-Way-Discovering-Recovering-Creative/dp/0330343580/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&linkCode=ll1&tag=e09d-21&linkId=1255e407d5ed9efa5d05419b9555b95e&language=en_GB">The Artists's way</a> to fully understand the morning pages exercise. <br />
       When I do my morning pages though I often get stuck half way and find it helpful to have these prompts accessible in front of me.</p>

       <p>1. What do I need to know?</p>

       <p>2. What do I need to try?</p>

       <p>3. What do I need to accept?</p>

       <p>4. What do I need to do?</p>

<p>Bonus question: "What should I do next?"</p>
 
  </div>
