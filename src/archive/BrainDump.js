    <p>Braindumping is an excellent way to clear your head. Your mind is for processing information and not storing it. Braindumping gets everything out of your head even things you didn't know were floating in there. Once its out of your head and onto paper you can process it and categorise it into tasks or just leave it there. Its completely up to you. It works so well.</p>
