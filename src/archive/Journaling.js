  <strong>Topics / Sections / whole notebooks / journals</strong><br /><br />

Dedicate a page to writing down your dreams
<br />Document your favourite outfits
<br />Create a spending plan (also known as a budget). Track every cent that you spend for the next 100 days to make sure that you’re sticking to your spending plan.
<br />Make a list of all of the commitments and social obligations that you have in the next 100 days. Then, take out a red pen and cross out anything that does not truly bring you joy or help move you along the path to achieving your main life goals.
<br />Create a housework chart - list of chores what tasks todo and when
<br />Blurb about you yourself your skills - for portfolio/quickly sending to people
<br />Things you frequently reference
<br />Things that inspire me
<br />Nice things people say about me
<br /><strong>Moments</strong>, is for recording any special moments I’d like to remember later. I tag them accordingly based on what type of moment they might be: conversations, dreams, something I feel the need to vent about. This journal gives me an outlet for my thoughts other than my boyfriend or best friend who I’m sure both appreciate the decrease in the number of rants I share.
<br /><strong>Goals</strong> journal where I store my yearly list of goals I’d like to work towards. I used to keep text files for each year, but it’s nice to be able to look back at them in one place whenever I want.
<br /><strong>Reviews</strong> is probably my most favorite journal. Despite the picture below making it seem like I only eat at [DuClaw](http://duclaw.com/), my boyfriend and I actually do enjoy trying new places to eat and drink, and this journal gives me a place to record what I love and, occasionally, what doesn’t love me back so that I know never to order it again.
<br />TIL, “Today I Learned”. It’s the newest journal and came from a recommendation on Lifehacker which happened to feature Day One in the screenshot. I haven’t been noting something I learned each day like the recommendation, but it will be helpful for capturing tidbits of information that would be helpful to retain that don’t necessarily have a place to be stored (e.g. where to send that random support request that only comes in once every 2 years).

<p><strong>Relationships</strong>
<br />
<br />

For the next 100 days, actively look for something positive in your partner every day, and write it down.
<br />Create a scrapbook of all the things you and your partner do together during the next 100 days. At the end of the 100 days, give your partner the list you created of positive things you observed about them each day, as well as the scrapbook you created.
